# Proof-of-Pickup
This project provides a Blockchain-Based Solution for Proof of Pick-up of a Physical Asset.

## Paper
*Abstract—Smart contracts, a by-product of Blockchain technology are a set of programs that are digitally verifiable and facilitate the automation of agreements between two or more parties without the intervention of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) service. The integration of smart contracts and Blockchain systems could help us in self-verifiable agreements between physical parties or processes. The paper deals with the application of an online delivery system, predominantly a food delivery system where the items ordered by a customer, when sent to the restaurant is verified by a smart contract that triggers automatically when the carrier picks up the order from the requested restaurant or seller. Since the smart contracts are distributed and transparent across a blockchain network the customer is aware and has definitive proof of where he has received his order from. In this paper, we give an implementation of how the smart contract would execute when the carrier picks up the order from the requested restaurant or seller and how this is reflected on the customer’s side with the help of Blockchain systems.*
